    <div class="prayerBodyParagraph">Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy,
        our life, our sweetness, and our hope.
        To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve;
        to you we send up our sighs,
        mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
        Turn, then, most gracious advocate,
        your eyes of mercy toward us;
        and after this, our exile,
        show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus.
        O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.</div>
